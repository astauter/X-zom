"# X-zom" 

Design Doc 2 for X-Zom

Overall story: In the aftermath of a zombie outbreak and you are in charge of a single survivor.

Art Style: 2-D top down pixel style. Clean and easy to comprehend over good graphics. Probably need help with this.

Gameplay: Turnbased roguelike during the fights. Out of fights there should be base building and development using supplies gathered. Time should count down on the world map day by day, with actions taking certain amount of time. So players can build up, develop, train or scout. But run out of time during the day. It should be a sacrifice, without enough time in the day for everything. 

	-Combat gameplay:I think it would be interesting to have small bitesized levels. Things that are similar to what small buildings would be like. Maybe there should occasionally be larger levels that would be more dangerous. Levels should be randomly generated. With diversity between house levels, small store levels, and large store levels. With more loot usually meaning more danger. Only a few characters can go on a mission at a time. There should also be a chance to run into other humans. They can be hostile or passive. This should be the main way a pc can recruit more characters. To recruit a character it could rely on a persuision check, a bribe or whatnot. Additionally not all characters will join, but some will trade with the pc. 

	-Hostile humans will be much more dangerous then zombies by far, guns will have a chance to kill or wound pretty easily, and are also able to bring more zombies due to noise. They will have very good loot on them however, things like backpacks, guns, ammo, and food.

Level Design: Levels should feel claustrophobic and dangerous. Running into a zombie in close corners should be dangerous for the pc. Also, making any noise should bring a chance of more zombies. Players should want to get in and out quickly. And think that retreat is a valid option at all times. Much better to lose food or medicine then a human.

Loot: Other then the necessities like food, medicine or fuel, there should sometimes be weapons or things that could be turned into weapons that are found. Mostly blunt weapons like clubs, baseball bats, or golf clubs, but sometimes rarer stuff will be found like guns or swords. 

Humans: Should have several stats, strength(carrying weight, melee damage, and health), agility/speed/reflexes(initiative, movement distance, possibly ranged accuracy), wit/int/brains(scavenging ability, skill checks, possibly persuation, maybe tactics). I don't want this to be too complicated with too many skills. Possibly all three tie into persuation, because a person is more likely to follow someone in shape over someone who looks weak. Humans starting stats could be linked to archtypes, i.e. Jock(strength, agility), Street Rat(wit, agility), Golden Child(all three). Not sure if the player should be able to level up the humans themselves or if they do so automatically. 

	Humans should also have skills in things that make non combat easier. Past jobs like Nurse/Doctor/Farmer/Gardener/Builder having a human with these jobs would make life easier on base with better healing, food growth, or defenses.

Raids: Should there be raids on your base? or should there just be warnings based on scouting and defense developments? Like the more you improve your base the less damage you take. Improvements could be scouting, walls, gardens, workshops and whatever else i can think of.
